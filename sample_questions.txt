It mentions \"variable pay inputs\" in section 13.1, but the context is unclear. To confirm if claims are used as payroll inputs, I would need more information on what is meant by \"claims\".\n\nSimilarly, the policy does not specifically mention exits as a payroll input related to running payroll. However, it does mention \"joining/exit data (date of joining, last working day, notice period recovery if applicable)\" in section 5.1.\n\nTo clarify these points and ensure accurate payroll processing, I would recommend consulting HR/payroll for additional information or guidance on payroll inputs and accuracy requirements.",
