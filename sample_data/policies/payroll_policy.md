- Description of issue
- Supporting evidence (attendance record, approval screenshot, etc.)
14.2 Suggested timeline:
- Employees should raise discrepancies as soon as possible after receiving the payslip.
14.3 Correction handling:
- If confirmed, corrections are typically processed in the next payroll as arrears/adjustments unless the impact requires an off-cycle correction.
14.4 Overpayments:
- If an overpayment occurs, Payroll/HR will communicate the recovery plan in advance. Recovery may be through future payroll deductions or other mutually communicated method, subject to applicable law and internal approvals.
14.5 Underpayments:
